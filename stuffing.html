    <p>If you're a regular to this website, you know the quality of the food here is higher than a giraffe's pussy. With that being said, I'm not sure if thats actually a picture of stuffing or an AI was asked to recreate the Chernobyl Elephant foot except really big. </p>
    
    <p>With that being said, here we fuckin go I guess.</p>
    
    <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
      <li>1 pound sliced fresh mushrooms </li>
      <li>3 stalks celery, diced</li>
      <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
      <li>1 (20 ounce) loaf French or Italian bread, cut into 1 inch cubes </li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package herb-seasoned stuffing mix</li>
      <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons rubbed sage </li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried thyme </li>

      <li>0.5 packs of cheap cigarettes</li>
      
    </ul>

    <p>You're not going to like this next part. There's nothing particularily bad about it, it's just a soul draining experience due to Ruth's deal with the devil. (please don't ask, she is very wrathful)</p>
